#### The AKS Primality Test *Deterministic*
> The AKS Primality Test was the first algorithim to have all four characteristics of:
> - General
> - Deterministic
> - Unconditional
> - Polynomial
>
> Another major breakthrough for this algorithm is that is was the first that could determine whether any given number was prime or composite within polynomial time 
> and this is achieved without relying on the *Generalized Riemann Hypothesis*. Arguably the biggest achievement of this algorithm is unliek many other algorithms that
> return a probability to the level of certainty that a number may be prime, the AKS algorithms can verify the primality of any general number is *Deterministically Correct*.
